Nonetheless, quite a few Derelicts rely on it as a primary or secondary weapon."},{"Name/Number":"Beamcaster",Content:"The Beamcaster appears to be a significantly modified heavy laser, but with capabilities more comparable to the common plasma rifle. Its beam retains its full strength even at up to 50% greater distance than most similar energy weapons, and is one of the most reliable of the known Derelict component designs."},{"Name/Number":"Blade Trap",Content:"A simple trap mechanism, though the effectiveness of forcibly detaching target components is not to be underestimated where hostile forces are incapable of rebuilding in the field."},{"Name/Number":"Brute Force Hacks",Content:"Like Trojans, increased use of this new class of offensive hack represents a shift in Derelict tactics. They have begun learning how to exploit system weaknesses to achieve some greater effect at the cost of destroying the system itself and losing any chance at further interaction. Some like Force(Overload) might prompt a complete redesign of the Fabricator system, as it was certainly never intended to be capable of such a dangerous effect. There is some satisfaction, however, in knowing that whatever Derelict uses that particular hack never makes it more than a few meters away from the machine."},{"Name/Number":"Cargo Convoy",Content:"Escorted A-27 Freighters are now responsible for delivering newer prototypes to DSF locations throughout Complex 0b10. As these prototypes are valuable for their higher rating and fact that they have been tested and confirmed non-faulty, they are often distributed through the Garrison network for added security."},{"Name/Number":"Caves",Content:"Approximately 15% of the subsurface cave systems surrounding Complex 0b1 were incorporated into the initial construction of Complex 0b10, but many more remain untouched.

Its behavior is quite unpredictable, no doubt a contributing factor in my misclassification since it resembles some of the actual Derelicts lurking in the depths. It won't be much use to capture it now, as it has clearly been tainted from its "experiences," but I should allow it to continue on its own for a time, as this is the perfect opportunity to collect data for further analysis before destroying it.

I call it the Cogmind. `},{"Name/Number":"Combat Hover Systems",Content:"As future engagements in off-world locations could very well involve traversing more hostile terrain than seen here on Tau Ceti IV, in order to bring heavier ground-based firepower to bear a new line of combat-oriented hover systems are under development.

No robot designs currently employ this technology, but it is being developed as a theoretical way to support vastly more powerful shield generators, or applied in other areas where only short but powerful bursts of energy are required."},{"Name/Number":"Cooled Weapons",Content:"Taking cues from Sigix Technology, I've been able to vastly improve the efficiency and versatility of early energy weapon designs. Based on recent prototype tests, cooled variants of these weapons output approximately one-third of their previous heat during normal operation, and can be overloaded with a dual burst of energy for twice as much damage potential. However, use of this feature would have to remain situational, as there is a small possibility of severe negative side effects. Overloading a cooled weapon also generates three times as much heat per shot, but that puts it on par with the original design and is often worth the significant damage boost."},{"Name/Number":"Core Stripper",Content:"While not always successful, this alternative melee weapon used by one of the Sigix strikes a target and delivers a surge of directed energy that aims to rip that target apart at its weakest seams. The Core Stripper is equipped with its own targeting system and tiny thrusters to correct its swing arc while in motion, thus even quickly moving targets have difficulty evading it."},{"Name/Number":"DSF",Content:"Distributed Storage Facility.

The Knight, Troll, Dragon, and Hydra classes are especially interesting."},{"Name/Number":"Derelict Rail Weapons",Content:"Derelicts have been working to develop longer-range cannons for use by larger robots, likely to facilitate guerilla warfare tactics to reduce their generally enormous losses whenever they decide to enter Complex 0b10. The first known type, a version of the gauss cannon, is known as the slug cannon and certainly does significant damage for its weight, but at a reduced accuracy. The newer hypervelocity variant, the bore cannon, is even less accurate, but capable of penetrating multiple targets with a high chance of disabling whatever it penetrates."},{"Name/Number":"Derelict Weaponry",Content:"Wherever possible Derelict robots tend to salvage and use discarded technology from my operations, but more recently they have begun to develop weapon systems of their own, showing a keen fascination with melee combat and unreliable but sometimes surprisingly powerful projectile weapons. These and other traits again prove that survival is indeed a strong creative motivator. Common Derelict weapons include the Beamcaster, Battle Rifle, and Derelict Rail Weapons, and even some electromagnetic designs like the Riot Gun and Arc Thrower."},{"Name/Number":"Dirty Bomb Trap",Content:"Likely another product of Derelict Tinkerers, when triggered this bomb generates an unusually high concentration of electromagnetic waves across its radius, capable of disabling an entire squad. An increasing number of patrols sent deep into the Caves have fallen to a combination of these traps and subsequent ambushes."},{"Name/Number":"Dirty Datajack",Content:"A new type of short-range datajack presumably developed by Derelict Tinkerers. The design is novel, diverging significantly from those developed by my researchers. It is extremely quick to use, but limited in what it can do as a result of lacking access to the garrison relay network. These opportunistic hacking devices are still incapable of any form of direct control and therefore do not yet pose a serious threat. Patrols in the Caves have recently recovered several large stashes of these, suggesting that Derelicts could be staging for some kind of attack."},{"Name/Number":"Disintegrator",Content:"Based on a rudimentary understanding of the Sigix Matter Drive, this weapon vaporizes a thin cylinder of matter over a short distance. The effect is uniform throughout the cylinder, and concentrated so tightly that zero collateral damage is caused beyond impaled target components, though direct hits almost always completely destroy the local component. A single shot requires a significant pool of energy, which is theoretically sustainable in combination with the latest reactor designs."},{"Name/Number":"Dragon",Content:"A Derelict Prototype apparently designed specifically to counter Complex 0b10 defenses, employing two nova cannons, presumably to counter Behemoths, as well as a powerful new type of Flamer. If more designs like this enter construction, I may have to launch a pre-emptive strike on the Caves before this escalation becomes a problem."},{"Name/Number":"EMDS",Content:"The Electromagnetic Delivery System encapsulates a powerful EM pulse device inside a large hypervelocity shell, making it possible to simultaneously strike multiple hardened targets, or penetrate a wall to hit such targets on the other side without a loss of either force or electromagnetic potential. Rather than using multi-direction pulses, each pulse is directed towards a specific target component to increase the chances of corrupting its parent system through brute force."},{"Name/Number":"Earth",Content:"Third planet from the Sun in the Solar System.

At that point I should make their destruction a priority to prevent them from falling into Derelict hands. "},{"Name/Number":"Experimental Legs",Content:"New variants of flexi-carbon, myomer, and biometal legs are 25% faster than the average leg design, sacrificing a small amount of support potential for significantly increased speed.

To ensure safe passage of response squads entering a potential hostile fire zone, the installation itself is reinforced against explosives and kinetic weaponry that might otherwise inflict excessive collateral damage. Corresponding defensive measures have rendered it somewhat weak against thermal attacks. For emergency situations where an area has been overrun, or a garrison has been infiltrated, the entrance and inner tunnel may be permanently sealed to prevent passage and contain the threat."},{"Name/Number":"Guided Launchers",Content:"Perfect accuracy can be achieved by taking existing launchers and pairing them with redirectable projectiles and a dedicated guidance system. I have yet to deploy any of these systems because demolishers are already incredibly accurate and the goal is to combine this technology with projectiles effective at extreme ranges so that demolishers can support a confrontation from a safe distance by targeting hostiles with assistance from spotters.

Based on our understanding of Complex 0b10 defense distribution practices, the benefit of each fabnet expansion is reduced to 1% per installation at two depths above the Fabricator's location. Therefore two fabnets installed at -7/Factory are presumed to trigger in 6% of cases at a depth of -6, and only 2% of cases at a depth of -5. The aggregate effects are not to be understated, however, where for example four active fabnet installs on the immediately lower depth, combined with three installs on the depth below that, would provide a combined 15% chance to trigger.
