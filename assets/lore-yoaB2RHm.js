My forces have never actually encountered one, but mining derelict records has uncovered information useful in dealing with them should that become necessary."},{"Name/Number":"Butcher",Content:"Butchers are duelist class variants armed with more damaging derelict-designed slashing weapons. Survival in the harsh and factious cave environment seems to drive derelicts towards the use of more violent weapons, and in some cases a preference for decisive close-quarters combat."},{"Name/Number":"Commander",Content:"Some derelict thugs in Warlord's service are promoted to commander roles, upgrading them with heavier firepower and better cooling. More problematic is their enhanced visual range and ability to improve the combat effectiveness of others in their squad, making them a prime target when encountered in the field."},{"Name/Number":"Decomposer",Content:"Decomposers are the precursor to K-class workers, converting debris to matter they leave behind for other robots to then collect and utilize. This was before the matter collection and redistribution process was centralized in Complex 0b10. Derelicts seem to have modified decomposers to break down even whole components."},{"Name/Number":"Demented",Content:"A relatively recent design, the so-called demented wander the caves corrupting nearby electronic systems. I suspect this one was devised by Warlord as an experiment in how to cause as much chaos as possible, or perhaps as a passive way to prevent Complex 0b10 patrols from venturing too deep into the caves."},{"Name/Number":"Fireman",Content:"The fireman is a relatively new robot discovered in the caves, purely of derelict design. Their flamer technology is extremely effective against my robots, thus I've instructed researchers to revisit my most common methods of electronics housing."},{"Name/Number":"Furnace",Content:"Furnace bots emit massive amounts of heat, causing nearby robots to overheat and become useless. I assume the design's aim is similar to that of the demented class derelict, built as a deterrent."},{"Name/Number":"Guerrilla",Content:"Derelicts have taken the original hunter and rearmed it with a weapon of their own design: the bore cannon. While the concentrated firepower is less effective in open firefights, its ability to deal significant damage even after penetrating multiple walls is surprising."},{"Name/Number":"Infiltrator",Content:"Fast movers designed around a main kinetic cannon with additional support from a pair of guns for close quarters engagements. Clearly built for long periods of operation in hostile territory, infiltrators aren't generally observed working with other units."},{"Name/Number":"Marauder",Content:"Inferior behemoth variants undoubtedly built by that idiot Warlord. They've only been reported deep in the caves, never anywhere near where an actual behemoth could tear them apart. They do possess respectable, if unreliable, firepower."},{"Name/Number":"Martyr",Content:"Despite their origins as older demolisher variants, martyrs do carry a rocket or missile launcher and are therefore considered extremely dangerous. Martyrs are rarely encountered anywhere near Complex 0b10, but those that are are promptly dealt with."},{"Name/Number":"Mutant",Content:"Lumbering abominations cobbled together from stolen or salvaged components, though much of their weaponry is derelict in origin. I believe the ever-stimulating Warlord is mass-producing these to lead an attack of some sort, since sightings by cave patrols have become increasingly common."},{"Name/Number":"Packrat",Content:"Packrats are sent out by their derelict owners to collect useful components for later reuse, especially those that derelicts are incapable of manufacturing locally. They are especially weak against electromagnetic attacks, and are disabled by programmers on sight."},{"Name/Number":"Parasite",Content:"Parasites remotely drain energy from all nearby robots for an unknown purpose. This can temporarily incapacitate the victims, but also cools them significantly."},{"Name/Number":"Samaritan",Content:"As a number of derelicts have insufficient or unreliable power supplies, some crafty derelict came up with the idea to create mobile recharging stations that generate and transmit energy to all nearby robot systems."},{"Name/Number":"Sapper",Content:"While sappers lack staying power in extended fights and therefore don't pose a direct threat, they are quickly becoming a headache due to their capacity for clandestine destruction, operating in isolated units that aren't even directed by Warlord. Sappers run their own missions then feed new route data to enemy forces, making them somewhat harder to track down."},{"Name/Number":"Savage",Content:"Savages are early B-series brawlers, before they were upgraded with better armor. They also swing mauls rather than the faster hammers and maces of new brawler variants."},{"Name/Number":"Surgeon",Content:"Surgeons are derelict-modified mechanics that combine repair and recycling in a single design. Without a recycling infrastructure to support manufacturing, derelict groups rely on surgeons to handle both tasks."},{"Name/Number":"Thief",Content:"Fast and extremely difficult to core, the thief is the most effective method derelict groups have of stealing new components directly from robots without excessive collateral damage. With a growing number of these in the caves, for now I'm reluctant to send any of the new prototypes to clear them out lest they steal that technology, too."},{"Name/Number":"Thug",Content:"A derelict improvement on the grunt that essentially fits them with a beamcaster, an interesting weapon of derelict origin. Some variants suffer serious heat issues from the added firepower, however."},{"Name/Number":"Tinkerer",Content:"I have minimal data on their capabilities, but the tinkerer design seems to be an evolution of C-series researchers."},{"Name/Number":"Wasp",Content:"Wasps are swarmer class variants equipped with a derelict-made battle rifle, less reliable than swarmer armament but nonetheless dangerous in large numbers."},{"Name/Number":"Wizard",Content:"The single most annoying derelict out there. Hiding from my patrols, hacking my robots, accessing my databases, corrupting systems with their riot guns... According to those captured and analyzed, although the wizard's design is related to the programmer, the changes necessary to break them free of the relay network could only have been designed by an extremely intelligent system."}],Content:"Analyses about derelict bots, obtainable at regular 0b10-controlled terminals via analysis() hacks."},{Name:"Prototype Analysis",Entries:[{"Name/Number":"Alpha 7",Content:"The Alpha 7 is a prototype for a new class of combat robot, very accurate with its multirail and heavy quantum rifle. Some experimental variants instead use an enhanced gamma rifle. Alpha 7s are built with strong defensive capabilities and triple-encased core technology, enabling them to easily take on multiple opponents simultaneously, while a more advanced version of the behemoth-style critical failure prevention system provides the same advantages in a smaller frame."},{"Name/Number":"Cetus Guard",Content:"Cetus Guards are a variant of the Y-72 outfitted with prototype technology, the first of many such experiments aimed at testing new designs in the field, albeit in this case located in an area that generally sees little to no hostile activity."},{"Name/Number":"Combat Programmer",Content:"As the first real front-line hacking bot, Combat Programmers are both shielded and armored to effectively face off against a variety of threats. While they possess significant hacking capabilities to make the most of time-critical situations, they also borrow the Lightning's EMDS and targeting systems, making them formidable even when outnumbered in combat. The latest model takes advantage of improved integrated shock resistance methods recently suggested by my researchers. Eventually a majority of programmers should be replaced with these combat variants."},{"Name/Number":"Executioner",Content:"The Executioner is a prototype for a new class of combat robot armed with dual helical railgun prototypes, capable of piercing targets at extreme range with extreme accuracy, often bypassing any and all armor to strike the target's core directly."},{"Name/Number":"Fortress",Content:"Only two Fortress prototypes have been built to garrison vital locations, utilizing the latest centrium armor technology and a wide array of other defensive components to render them nearly immune to all forms of damage. While their offensive capabilities are limited to two powerful cannons, even a small army would have difficulty overcoming a Fortress before it picks them off one by one."},{"Name/Number":"Investigator",Content:"Investigators are built specifically to oversee the testing of dangerous prototypes, and are therefore capable of holding multiple threats in place while supporting units deal with them."},{"Name/Number":"Lightning",Content:"A specialized hunter prototype not yet in wide deployment, currently only used to defend sensitive areas in more maze-like environments where it can quickly dispatch of intruders through walls with its experimental EMDS. It also remains completely undetectable by any known non-visual sensor, and can even survive direct engagements against multiple hostiles with the aid of the most advanced cloaking technology to date."},{"Name/Number":"M Guard",Content:"The first application of prototype AEGIS shielding is naturally found in the most important of designs, my own guards. With enough energy to power it through extended confrontations even while protecting nearby allies, it would almost be enough to justify accompanying M Guards with additional squads of front-line robots, if not for their powerful AOE weaponry making close-quarters combat with allied forces problematic."},{"Name/Number":"Quarantine Guard",Content:"Designed for the sole purpose of maintaining maximum operating efficiency in high-heat environments, Quarantine Guards are the most powerful and advanced Y-72 variant to date, supporting dual hypercooled linear accelerators with extra matter storage and a backup power source in combination with an array of heat management utilities."},{"Name/Number":"S7 Guard",Content:"S7 Guards are the first variant in a new line of sentry frames, better fulfilling their purpose with built-in resistance to most forms of damage, and self-regenerating armor to ensure long-term defense of a position until reinforcements can arrive."},{"Name/Number":"Striker",Content:"The Striker is a prototype for a new class of combat robot, a large yet fast flier that fires its primary linear accelerator while approaching a target before engaging in melee with a plasma lance. An experimental reaction system makes the Striker more difficult to hit on approach despite its large size. The plasma lance is highly effective at skewering target cores."},{"Name/Number":"Superbehemoth",Content:"Superbehemoth prototypes, now in their third revision, are the answer to increasingly powerful yet maneuverable derelict robots, which can attack guerrilla style then retreat into a network of narrow caves to avoid pursuit by the heaviest assault forces. Future efforts to completely clear and protect the Proximity Caves will require a more versatile heavy attacker capable of quickly burrowing through rock. To that end, Superbehemoth frames are embedded with a weaker version of the Sigix Matter Drive, while also carrying enough different weaponry to deal with a variety of threats without supporting units."},{"Name/Number":"Tracker",Content:"Trackers are still new designs that may need more updates, but will no doubt become vital in the effort to protect my most important assets. Their built-in drive enables them to catch up to anything ever spotted coming out of the caves so far, and although they're equipped with valuable technology themselves, rather than harden them with armor and slow them down, Trackers have improved evasive capabilities to help avoid getting hit in the first place. The combination of rapid-fire Linked Autogun and Immobilizer for slowing fast targets will make derelicts think twice before raiding upper 0b10 for spare parts."}],Content:"Analyses about prototype 0b10 bots, obtainable at regular 0b10-controlled terminals via analysis() hacks.",Spoiler:"Spoiler"}];export{e as l};
